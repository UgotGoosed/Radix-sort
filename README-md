# Project Title

Write a program that randomly generates 1 million integers and sorts them using radix sort

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

I would have to use the radix sort to sort 1 million integers. I would have to create and array
and assign it to have one million integers. I would then have to randomize those integers into the array
so that they were not in order. I would then have to set up a method to sort these integers out.


### Design

used one class and one method.
the method would set up how the array was sorted using radix sort. 

### Testing

had to set up an array list to 10 for 10 buckets so that the numbers 0-9 
could be sorted by their radix position. 

I then had to create for loops to move the variables to and from buckets from the array.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
